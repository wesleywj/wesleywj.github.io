excerpt: 'Much research has highlighted the association between early life stressors and accelerated biological ageing. Less attention has, however, attempted to disentangle temporal effects from the cumulative effect of adversity exposure on epigenetic ageing. This study employs a statistical learning approach to examine how different types of adverse childhood experiences (poverty, instability, deprivation, and maltreatment) relate to epigenetic ageing in late childhood. Additionally, it evaluates which of the three life course hypotheses –sensitive periods, recency, and cumulative risk– best explains this relationship. Results suggest that the sensitive period hypothesis is the strongest predictor of accelerated biological ageing across all types of adverse experiences. Moreover, epigenetic ageing predicts health outcomes and accelerated life history strategies in later life, mediating the link between adversity exposure during sensitive periods and health or life history outcomes. By identifying sensitive periods of biological vulnerability, our results advance understanding of how early adversity becomes biologically embedded and point to new directions for prevention-focused research.'
