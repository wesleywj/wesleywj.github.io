## Welcome!

I'm a PhD student pursuing a dual-title PhD in Sociology & Gerontology in Purdue University. I have earlier graduated from the University of Oxford with an MPhil in Sociology & Demography. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6r-6Mf9gbDxRVyukUaMD_ue6AmeBFWU/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.


## Primary Interests

My research lies primarily in the intersection between gene and environment (GxE), and how it contributes to inequalities across the life course. I am also interested in exploring differences in social outcomes induced by life course trajectories through computational methods (e.g., agent-based models; 
ML-based models).

## Ongoing Projects

I am currently collaborating with Dr. Evelina Akimova and Dr. Robyn Stryker 
    to investigate social pathways linking educational attainment and ADHD 
    polygenic scores to later life achievements. 

Simultaneously, I am collaborating with some truly impressive scholars -- including but not limited to Nanum Jeon (UCLA); Yanji Du (UCLA); and Aitor Garcia (Spanish Research Council) -- to simulate health outcomes under counterfactual life course scenarios using machine learning-based G-Computation.
