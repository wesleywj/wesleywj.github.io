## Welcome!

I'm a PhD student pursuing a dual-title PhD in Sociology & Gerontology in Purdue University. I have earlier graduated from the University of Oxford with an MPhil in Sociology & Demography. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6r-6Mf9gbDxRVyukUaMD_ue6AmeBFWU/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.


## Primary Interests

My research lies primarily in the intersection between gene and environment (GxE), and how it contributes to inequalities across the life course. I am also interested in exploring differences in social outcomes induced by life course trajectories through computational methods (e.g., agent-based models; 
ML-based models).

## Ongoing Projects

I am currently collaborating with Dr. Evelina Akimova and Dr. Robyn Stryker 
    to investigate social pathways linking educational attainment and ADHD 
    polygenic scores to later life achievements. 

Simultaneously, I am collaborating with some truly impressive scholars -- including but not limited to Nanum Jeon (UCLA); Yanji Du (UCLA); and Aitor Garcia (Spanish Research Council) -- to simulate health outcomes under counterfactual life course scenarios using machine learning-based G-Computation.




) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
