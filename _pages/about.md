## Welcome!

I'm a dual-title PhD student in Sociology & Gerontology at Purdue University. I have earlier graduated from the University of Oxford with an MPhil in Sociology & Demography. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6r-6Mf9gbDxRVyukUaMD_ue6AmeBFWU/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.


## Primary Interests

My research lies primarily in the intersection between gene and environment (GxE), and how it contributes to inequalities across the life course. I am also interested in exploring differences in social outcomes induced by life course trajectories through computational methods (e.g., agent-based models; 
ML-based models).

## Ongoing Projects

I am currently collaborating with Dr. Evelina Akimova and Dr. Robyn Stryker to investigate social pathways linking educational attainment and ADHD polygenic scores to later life achievements. 

Concurrently, I am working with some truly impressive scholars --including but not limited to Nanum Jeon (UCLA); Yanji Du (UCLA); and Aitor Garcia (Spanish Research Council)-- to simulate health outcomes under counterfactual life course scenarios using machine learning-based G-Computation. This ongoing project is part of the [Population and Social Data Science Summer Incubator Program 2025](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/news_events_6123/news_press_releases_4630/news/population_and_social_data_science_summer_incubator_program_2025_14343) hosted at the Max Planck Institute of Demographic Research.
